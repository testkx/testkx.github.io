		<div>Agriculture is the dominant land use in Ohio and is one of our state’s leading
industries. Water quality impacts associated with farming activities have therefore
received a lot of attention. CFAES faculty are working hard to understand how
to control nonpoint source pollution—pollution that comes from many diffuse
sources—and help farmers enhance sustainability, improving their environmental
footprint while remaining productive and profitable.

		<div>Urban areas also create water quality challenges. A number of CFAES faculty and
staff focus their efforts on understanding and reducing impacts from stormwater
runoff, aging water system infrastructure in urban areas, and wastewater streams
from food processing and manufacturing.

		<div>Preventing losses of nutrients and contaminants from rural and urban areas is
only part of the answer to solving water quality challenges. It is equally important
to understand the factors that shape the overall health of aquatic ecosystems in
wetlands, rivers, and lakes. CFAES faculty include some of the nation’s premier
environmental scientists studying aquatic ecosystem health and restoration.
